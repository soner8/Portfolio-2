# Portfolio Site üåê

## Background

This project was conceived for two reasons: 
1) I wanted to gain more experience working with React and Components
2) I wanted to test my knowledge of front-end, mobile-first design

In order to kickstart this project, I opted to use React's Command Line Interface. This made it easy to focus on building my site rather than configuring it. 

For deployment, I chose to use S3 on AWS. I chose S3 over other hosting platforms for two reasons:
1) Easy Configuration
2) Price
